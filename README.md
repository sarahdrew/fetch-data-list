# Fetch Data List

### GitHub Pages Link:

## To Get Project Started:

clone project, cd fetch-data-list, npm install or yarn install, npm start or yarn start

### To Run Tests:

yarn test

### Objective of project:

Display this list of items to the user based on the following requirements:

- Display all the items grouped by "listId"
- Sort the results first by "listId" then by "name" when displaying.
- Filter out any items where "name" is blank or null.

The final result should be displayed to the user in an easy-to-read list.

### Additional Notes to Developers:

I chose to complete this task in React because I saw that Fetch often uses React and because it's the language I feel most comfortable in. Although this task is currently a single component displayed, React allows this project to be easily built on. It would be easy and efficient to add more components in addition to the work that is already completed.
